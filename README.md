Sentiment analysis using deep learning models and FastText embedding on Apache Spark
I implemented a sentiment analysis model on Twitter using Apache Spark. I used FastText embeddings and deep learning RNN models (LSTM, GRU, and CNN). Also, this work included a pre-processing framework based on Dataframe that performs much better than RDD-based architectures in terms of processing time and volume of data that can be processed.
In addition, I used MongoDB and Apache Cassandra as this model's databases and compared them to the Apache Spark file storing and retrieving system.

We also published an article for introducing a Dataframe based pre-processing framework that you can get from here:

I hope this will be useful for you ;)
